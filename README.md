# Generative-AI-with-Large-Language-Models-Coursera
This repository contains my personal notes and Jupyter notebooks from the "Generative AI with LLMs" course. It includes lectures, examples, exercises, and experiments with large language models, covering topics such as tokenization, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and text generation.
